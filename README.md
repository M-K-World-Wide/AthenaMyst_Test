## 🚀 AthenaMyst-Test: Public AI Interface Demo

AthenaMyst-Test is a public, Node.js-based showcase of the Athena AI interface. It provides a safe, open API and UI for external collaborators, researchers, and supporters to interact with AthenaMyst’s architecture and contribute ideas—while safeguarding the divine core.

- **Node.js/Express API**: Mock AI endpoint for demo/testing
- **React UI**: Minimal, public-friendly interface (no secrets, no trading logic)
- **No privileged or internal code**: All sensitive logic is replaced with mocks or placeholders
